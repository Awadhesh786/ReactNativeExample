React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Weband UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities.

In 2012 Mark Zuckerberg commented, "The biggest mistake we made as a company was betting too much on HTML as opposed to native". He promised that Facebook would soon deliver a better mobile experience.

Inside Facebook, Jordan Walke found a way to generate UI elements for iOS from a background JavaScript thread. They decided to organise an internal Hackathon to perfect this prototype in order to be able to build native apps with this technology.

After months of development, Facebook released the first version for the React JavaScript Configuration in 2015. During a technical talk, Christopher Chedeau explained that Facebook was already using React Native in production for their Group App and their Ads Manager App.

The working principles of React Native are virtually identical to React except that React Native does not manipulate the DOM via the Virtual DOM. It runs in a background process (which interprets the JavaScript written by the developers) directly on the end-device and communicates with the native platform via a serialisation, asynchronous and batched Bridge.

React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via Reactâ€™s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript. This enables native app development for whole new teams of developers, and can let existing native teams work much faster.

React Native does not use HTML or CSS. Instead, messages from the JavaScript thread are used to manipulate native views. React Native also allows developers to write native code in languages such as Java for Android and Objective-C or Swift for iOS which make it even more flexible.

### What's going on here?
Some of the things in here might not look like JavaScript to you. Don't panic. This is the future.

First of all, ES2015 (also known as ES6) is a set of improvements to JavaScript that is now part of the official standard, but not yet supported by all browsers, so often it isn't used yet in web development. React Native ships with ES2015 support, so you can use this stuff without worrying about compatibility. import, from, class, and extends in the example above are all ES2015 features. If you aren't familiar with ES2015, you can probably pick it up by reading through sample code like this tutorial has. If you want, this page has a good overview of ES2015 features.

The other unusual thing in this code example is <View><Text>Hello world!</Text></View>. This is JSX - a syntax for embedding XML within JavaScript. Many frameworks use a specialized templating language which lets you embed code inside markup language. In React, this is reversed. JSX lets you write your markup language inside code. It looks like HTML on the web, except instead of web things like <div> or <span>, you use React components. In this case, <Text> is a built-in component that displays some text and View is like the <div> or <span>.

### Components
So this code is defining HelloWorldApp, a new Component. When you're building a React Native app, you'll be making new components a lot. Anything you see on the screen is some sort of component. A component can be pretty basic - the only thing that's required is a render function which returns some JSX to render.

### DrawerLayoutAndroid
React component that wraps the platform DrawerLayout (Android only). The Drawer (typically used for navigation) is rendered with renderNavigationView and direct children are the main view (where your content goes). The navigation view is initially not visible on the screen, but can be pulled in from the side of the window specified by the drawerPosition prop and its width can be set by the drawerWidth prop.

### Images
# Static Image Resources
React Native provides a unified way of managing images and other media assets in your Android and iOS apps. To add a static image to your app, place it somewhere in your source code tree and reference it like this:

_<Image source={require('./my-icon.png')} />_
The image name is resolved the same way JS modules are resolved. In the example above, the packager will look for my-icon.png in the same folder as the component that requires it. Also, if you have my-icon.ios.png and my-icon.android.png, the packager will pick the correct file for the platform.
